### Manifesto

Acknowledging some will disagree especially those that have a vested interest in the credentialing, testing and certification communities.

Firstly, I¡¦ll tell you what you shouldn¡¦t do to become a good programmer. No matter what anybody tells you, if you spend too much time doing any of the following things it might improve your skills a little, but you will never be a good programmer:

    You won¡¦t become a good programmer by just reading books.
    You won¡¦t become a good programmer by memorising code and algorithms. Programming is about thinking not about remembering. You can have the best memory, but if you¡¦re not thinking for yourself you¡¦ll NEVER be a good programmer i.e. we have computers and the internet to remember things for us, so there¡¦s no need for you to remember anything - you just need to know where and how to find the information you need.
    You won¡¦t become a good programmer by writing single functions and algorithms from the books you read i.e. writing stupid bubble sort functions and similar useless algorithms.
    You won¡¦t become a good programmer by testing other people¡¦s code e.g. whether testing software by using it or writing unit tests etc.
    You won¡¦t become a good programmer by reading and debugging other people¡¦s code. This might help in the short term, but only if the other person¡¦s code is well written so you can pick up some good habits, but using bad code as examples will teach you bad habits that you will ultimately have to unlearn. In the long term spending too much time reading and debugging other people¡¦s code will be detrimental to your growth.
    You won¡¦t become a good programmer by allowing others to micro manage you ¡K because again programming is about thinking for yourself.

There¡¦s only one way to become a good programmer: you have to take on a project and start it and finish it yourself from beginning to end. Don¡¦t focus too much on reading books, syntax, algorithms and functions i.e. don¡¦t focus on details at the beginning. Simply sit and think about an app/system you¡¦d like to develop for yourself ¡K something you¡¦d really enjoy building and using for yourself. Ask your friends/family/lecturers for an idea if you need to, but you must start the project from scratch and finish it by yourself from beginning to end. Once you¡¦ve gotten the idea, keep the idea in your head and be passionate about finishing it ¡K from there everything will slowly start to come together. You will have features in your mind that you want to implement at which point you will start researching how to implement this or that. It¡¦s only at this point that you should pick up a book or search the internet for answers about how to implement this cool feature you¡¦ve thought of doing. As your app/system grows you will slowly by yourself start thinking about writing cleaner code to maintain it in the future to make your own life easier."

The one important item to emphasize supporting automation is:
"You won¡¦t become a good programmer by memorising code and algorithms. Programming is about thinking not about remembering. You can have the best memory, but if you¡¦re not thinking for yourself you¡¦ll NEVER be a good programmer i.e. we have computers and the internet to remember things for us, so there¡¦s no need for you to remember anything - you just need to know where and how to find the information you need."


It is only through the process and struggle of bringing your own idea to life that you will learn how to become a good programmer. You should see yourself as an artist, not just as guy who writes

code to get it to compile and run. If you¡¦re only working on someone else¡¦s code, or only reading books etc. you will lose your motivation very quickly and you will never find or utilize your talent."

The one point of emphasis that also supports _automation_ that is very important: 
*"You won¡¦t become a good programmer by memorising code and algorithms. Programming is about thinking not about  remembering. You can have the best memory, but if you¡¦re not thinking for yourself you¡¦ll NEVER be a good  programmer i.e. we have computers and the internet to remember things for us, so there¡¦s no need for you to remember anything - you just need to know where and how to find the information you need."*

### So How Do I do this? You ask. (A Study in Automation)

The 2 greatest computer discoveries are 1) Cut and Paste,  2) the internet. Don't laugh! with the extension of these two single inventions the computer has become the single most powerful tool that is changing the face of the earth as we speak. Speaking more fundamentally what these are essentially is memory and the ability of computers to communicate with each other.

### Some Tools:

[binSnippets Repository](https://github.com/RayNieva/binSnippets)

- [Sheet2 Code](https://github.com/RayNieva/binSnippets/blob/master/Sheet2Code.vb)Developed at when I was at DA is also an example of Excel VBA writing more VBA for Outlook too (output is automatically created in debug.print, actually output could have been any language not just VB) Using code to write code. Code generation.. don't re-write code twice to do essentially the same thing.
- [Contacts Class](https://github.com/RayNieva/binSnippets/blob/master/Contacts02-26-14.rb) Also developed when I was at DA, Object Oriented (Ruby) essentially enables creating code that can be reused by another script. [Aname.rb](https://github.com/RayNieva/binSnippets/blob/master/aname.rb) is a script that calls the methods in the Contacts class, but once created the Contacts class can be used in any script I can decide to create going forward in virtually any relevant application.

[Synergy](https://symless.com/synergy) 
Creates the ultimate fat client. The computers in the photo above are two dual-boot Linux/Windows 7/Windows 10 computers. They can be mix and matched in any mode(Linux to Windows, Linux to Linux and Windows to Windows) and still share keyboard, mouse AND CLIPBOARD!  Futhermore if Synergy fails, the back-up is a hardware KVM. This is all possible thru the magic of _network protocols_ that even allows _memory sharing_ between two or more computers!
